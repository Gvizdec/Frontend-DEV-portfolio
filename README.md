# Frontend-DEV-portfolio
I'ts a portfolio of projects i made to show my skills in Java Script, CSS, HTML. I'm going to attach this repositorium to my resumes when aplying for job.

My first JavaScript app i have ever made is todo list. What it makes different from other todo lists "projects" you can find on the internet it is actually fully functional app. It can be saved and edited later.
